# Food Cost: The Essential Guide for Restaurateurs Who Want to Stop Guessing ‚Äì and Start Deciding

**Are you running your restaurant on instinct?** Ordering "by feel"? Discovering your real margins only at month-end... when it's too late?

**You're not alone.** But you're about to change everything.

Food cost isn't just an accounting figure. It's **the lifeblood** of your profitability. And the difference between guessing and deciding can represent tens of thousands of dollars per year.

## What is Food Cost? (And Why You Should Lose Sleep Over It)

### The Simple Definition

**Food cost** represents the percentage of your revenue spent on purchasing ingredients.

**Basic Formula:**
```
Food Cost % = (Ingredient Cost / Sales) √ó 100
```

### Real Example

Your restaurant generates **$100,000** in sales this month.
You spent **$32,000** on ingredients.

**Your food cost = 32%**

**Is this good or bad?** It depends. And that's where it gets interesting.

## Benchmarks by Restaurant Type

Here are the healthy food cost ranges according to your establishment type:

| Restaurant Type | Ideal Food Cost |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Fast-food** | 25-30% |
| **Casual dining** | 28-35% |
| **Fine dining** | 30-38% |
| **Pizzeria** | 25-32% |
| **Caf√©/Bistro** | 30-35% |
| **Sushi/Fresh fish** | 35-40% |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** These figures are averages. Your target food cost depends on your business model, price positioning, and local market.

## The 3 Fatal Errors That Kill Your Margin

### Error #1: Calculating Your Food Cost Once a Month

**The Problem:** You discover your food cost is at 42% on the 5th of the following month. Too late to act.

**The Solution:** Track your food cost **in real-time** or at minimum **weekly**.

### Error #2: Ignoring Waste

**The Problem:** You calculate your theoretical food cost, but ignore:
- Expired products thrown away
- Overly generous portions
- Order mistakes
- Theft (yes, it happens)

**The Reality:** Waste represents on average **4-10%** of your food purchases.

### Error #3: Not Knowing Food Cost Per Dish

**The Problem:** Your overall food cost is at 32%, but:
- Your tartare is at 45% (you're losing money)
- Your margherita pizza is at 18% (you could lower the price)
- You don't know it

**The Solution:** Calculate the food cost of **every dish** on your menu.

## How to Calculate Your Real Food Cost (Not the Theoretical One)

### Method 1: Period Food Cost (Monthly)

```
Food Cost % = ((Beginning Stock + Purchases - Ending Stock) / Sales) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
- Beginning stock: $8,000
- Monthly purchases: $25,000
- Ending stock: $7,000
- Monthly sales: $85,000

**Calculation:**
```
Food Cost = ((8,000 + 25,000 - 7,000) / 85,000) √ó 100
Food Cost = (26,000 / 85,000) √ó 100
Food Cost = 30.6%
```

### Method 2: Food Cost Per Dish

**For your signature burger:**

| Ingredient | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total Cost |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Brioche bun | 1 unit | $0.85 | $0.85 |
| AAA beef | 180g | $12/kg | $2.16 |
| Aged cheddar | 30g | $18/kg | $0.54 |
| Bacon | 2 slices | $0.40 | $0.80 |
| Vegetables/condiments | - | - | $0.65 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$5.00** |

**Selling price:** $18
**Dish food cost:** (5.00 / 18) √ó 100 = **27.8%**

**‚úÖ Excellent!** This dish is profitable.

## The 5 Levers to Optimize Your Food Cost

### 1. Negotiate with Your Suppliers

**Strategies that work:**
- Compare 3 suppliers minimum for each category
- Negotiate volume prices (even for a single restaurant)
- Ask for promotions and end-of-series
- Pay quickly to get discounts

**Potential gain: 5-15% on your purchases**

### 2. Standardize Your Recipes

**The Problem:** Each cook does it "their way". Result: inconsistent portions, variable costs, uneven quality.

**The Solution:**
- Detailed technical sheets for each dish
- Precise weights (not "a handful of cheese")
- Team training
- Regular quality controls

**Potential gain: 3-8% food cost**

### 3. Optimize Your Menu

**Profitability analysis per dish:**

Classify your dishes into 4 categories:

| Category | Popularity | Profitability | Action |
|----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| **Stars** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | üí∞üí∞üí∞ | Keep, highlight |
| **Cash cows** | ‚≠ê | üí∞üí∞üí∞ | Increase visibility |
| **Puzzles** | ‚≠ê | üí∞ | Improve or remove |
| **Workhorses** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | üí∞ | Optimize cost |

**Potential gain: 5-12% food cost**

### 4. Reduce Waste

**Concrete actions:**
- Weekly inventories (not monthly)
- Strict FIFO (First In, First Out)
- Controlled portions with scales
- Creative reuse of leftovers
- Anti-waste training

**Real example:** A $500,000 revenue restaurant reduces its waste from 8% to 4% = **$20,000 saved/year**

## The Truth About Food Cost That Nobody Tells You

2. **Track** it regularly (not once a month)
3. **Optimize** it continuously (not once and for all)
4. **Balance** it with customer satisfaction
